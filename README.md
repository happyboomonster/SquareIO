# SquareIO
A bad clone of Agar.io with horrible (getting better) netcode

This game requires Pygame to be installed. It also requires Python 3. Python 2 does not work (I've tested).

IN ORDER FOR THE GAME TO START UP, PLEASE RENAME THE "rename.pkl" FILE TO "options.pkl".
THE GAME WILL START ONCE THAT IS FINISHED.
